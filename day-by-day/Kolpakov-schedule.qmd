## 1. Monday 6 January, 2025

Orientation to QR2

- Readings:
    - Spiegelhalter Introduction
    - Rosling Introduction
    - Note: As a rule, you should do preparatory reading *before* class. For the first days of class, we shall make an exception, and probably discuss a few things on the tangent, too. 

- Discussion:
    - Learning about data and statistics
    - Spiegelhalter Introduction
    - Rosling Introduction
    - Note: The items under the "Discussion" header in this document are just FYI. The readings and the reading questions are the appropriate preparation.

- Computing:
    - Please have your laptops with you! There will be a few *in-class* computing exercises.
    - The main computing tool for this class is R. You do not need to install it on your computer, although you definitely may.

## Further out (i.e. tentative)

::: {.callout-note}
## 3. Monday 13 January, 2025

Block 1 (cont.)

- New readings:
    a. `r tutorial_link(1)`
    b. Rosling Chap 2 [questions](../questions/R2-before.html)

- Assignments due before class time: 
    - Remember that the "New readings" section has links to the relevant reading questions. 
    - For the computing tutorials, there are no "questions" as such, but be sure to run and, better, play around with the Active R Chunks. Then go through the familiar "Collect answers" and submission process. Your "answers" will be the contents of the Active R Chunks that you have run. 
    - These principles apply to all class sessions, but won't be restated explicitly in other day's itemizations.


- Discussions and Activities
    i. Rosling reading
    ii. Review of Computing Tutorial 1
    iii. In-class group work on computing activities (TBA)
