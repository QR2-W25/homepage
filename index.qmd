## Resources from Winter 2025
There were six sections of QR2 offered in the Winter 2025 term, taught by five different instructors.

It's impractical (and probably not optimal) for all the sections to be identical. Different sections meet on different days and instructors are most effective when teaching in their individual styles.

- [Section 1 (Prof. Ruth)](day-by-day/Ruth-schedule.html)
- [Section 2 (Prof. Kolpakov)](day-by-day/Kolpakov-schedule.html)
- [Section 3 (Prof. Kolpakov)](day-by-day/Kolpakov-schedule.html)
- [Section 4 (Prof. Puelz)](https://github.com/dpuelz/Quantitative-Reasoning-II)
- [Section 5 (Prof. Overbey)](https://github.com/eliah-o/Quantitative-Reasoning-II)
- [Section 6 (Prof. Kaplan)](day-by-day/Kaplan-schedule.html)

## General information

Textbooks:

1. David Spiegelhalter, *The Art of Statistics: Learning from Data*
2. Hans Rossling, *Factfulness*
3. QR 2 *Computing Tutorials* [free and online](https://dtkaplan.github.io/QR2-computing/)

Computing:

Our data-science computing platform is embedded into each course document that involves computing. You do not need to install any special software; just an up-to-date web browser will do. No previous experience with technical software is required. For those interested in such things, the underlying platform is R along with the `dplyr` data-wrangling system, products that are extensively used professionally in data science. 

Policies: [See the syllabus page](syllabus.html)

Much of the required course work---reading questions, computing activities and exercises, and so on---is arranged for easy electronic submission. The uploading file uses your `@uaustin.org` email address.
