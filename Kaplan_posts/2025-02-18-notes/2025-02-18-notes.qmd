1. In groups of 3 or 4 people, discuss for 3 minutes the distinction, if any, between "precision" and "accuracy". Then we'll report back to the class.

2. Discuss Figure 9.2 from Spiegelhalter, the funnel plot. Discuss what's going on ... we have some standard theories for why the colon-cancer death rate might be different from district to district: different diets, different age structures, environmental toxins, etc. In formulating an explanation for the district-to-district variation in death rate, we need to account for an inevitable factor that stems from mathematics and not biological pathology: the variation induced by sample size.

2. Construct the Linda simulation: Randomly picking 12 cases out of a population in which 92% of the cases turned out heads, with 8% turning out tails.

3. Talk about Eitan Zarin's persons and households.
