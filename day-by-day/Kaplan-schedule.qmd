Orientation to QR2

- Readings:
    - Spiegelhalter Introduction [Link to a randomly selected seller](https://www.hpb.com/the-art-of-statistics-how-to-learn-from-data/M-3646261-T.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=HPB_PMAX_ECOM&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAvvO7BhC-ARIsAGFyToXt03joDgue1IfapmsUC7FSrPIrBt4o2wGL1XtdVzn4olcYDoFnKgQaAhLMEALw_wcB)
    - Rosling Introduction [Link to a randomly selected seller of the book](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/factfulness-ten-reasons-we-re-wrong-about-the-world-and-why-things-are-better-than-you-think-9781250123824?shipto=US&curcode=USD&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAvvO7BhC-ARIsAGFyToW5RAPaZ6PKkhyWmLKWQprHQbJWUaQ-bG7qdB8L9jYw4FExpc4ZaSkaAgw-EALw_wcB)
    - Note: As a rule, you should have completed a first pass of the day's readings *before* the class meets. This being the first day, I can only ask to to try to do so.

## Further out (i.e. tentative)

::: {.callout-note}
## 3. Tuesday 14 January, 2025

Block 1 (cont.)

- New readings:
    a. `r tutorial_link(1)` Make sure to play around with the different commands, changing names, etc. Each time you run an active R chunk, that activity is stored in your browser until you close or refresh the page. Submitting your work using the button and link at the bottom of the document will let me see what you've done, and will be a component of class participation.
    b. Rosling Chap 2 [questions](../questions/R2-before.html)

- Assignments due before class time: 
    - Remember that the "New readings" section has links to the relevant reading questions. 
    - For the computing tutorials, there are no "questions" as such, but be sure to run and, better, play around with the Active R Chunks. Then go through the familiar "Collect answers" and submission process. Your "answers" will be the contents of the Active R Chunks that you have run. 
    - These principles apply to all class sessions, but won't be restated explicitly in other day's itemizations.


- Discussions and Activities
    i. Rossling reading
    ii. Review of Computing Tutorial 1
    iii. In-class group work on computing activities (TBA)
