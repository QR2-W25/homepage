Equally important, however, are the many R Chunks. You’re expected to play around a bit as you work through the tutorial, trying out different commands, changing names, etc. Make mistakes! That’s a great way to learn. Each time you run an R chunk, that activity is stored in your browser until you close or refresh the page. Submit your work using the button and link at the bottom of the tutorial document. This will let me see what you’ve done, and will be a component of class participation.\nIf you stop part way through a document with questions, chunks, etc., submit your work up to that point. When you return to the document, you can do additional work and submit that. You don’t have to worry about submitting multiple times.\nNote that when you close a document tab, your previous entries are forgotten. But any submissions that you made previously are still safely stored at the submission collection site.\n\nIn-class notes"

For example, something can be bad overall (like poverty being high) but can be trending in a direction indicating that it’s getting better.

Selective reporting by media acts on this human instinct by choosing what the audience remembers.”\n\n\nFear instinct\n\n\n“Fear Instinct is that natural fear that human beings possess whether it be heights, spiders, snakes, ect. These are instinctive because when everyone was at level 1, they were constant threats to daily survival. To those who are still on level 1, the fear instinct is helpful, but to those on level 4, it can be considered a phobia. Phobias can often highjack ones life and make them think they are in danger when really there is no danger at all.”\n\n\nWhy have natural disasters become less dangerous?\n\n\n“Rosling says that the number of casualties from natural disasters decreased over the last century because of advancements in technology.”\n\n\nWhat are some examples?\n\n\nFear factors\nAnchoring (from Kahnemann and Tverskey)"

    "text": "This is a challenging but important chapter. The techniques Spiegelhalter mentions (“random forests,” “logistic regression,” “support vector machines”, among others) seem like wizards’ incantations. The book was published in 2019. Even in the few years since then, other techniques have found their way into popular culture: —e.g. “deep learning,” “generative pre-trained transformers” (GPT).\nSpiegelhalter chooses to exemplify all this very recent, ongoing development with one of the very oldest methods: “classification trees” from the 1960s. This is a good choice in many ways. It requires little training to calculate the output from a classification tree given the explanatory variable inputs. And, although Spiegelhalter doesn’t show how such trees are created, the process is readily understandable if presented step by step.\nThe chapter title is “Algorithms, Analytics, and Prediction.” Let’s take some of the mystery out of “algorithm” and “analytics.” To analyze means simply “taking apart.” It is the opposite of synthesize: “putting together.” The “classification tree” is a matter to taking a data frame apart into separate sets of rows, then aggregating each set to make a prediction (e.g. a 16% change of survival for the Misters)\nAn “algorithm” is a recipe or set of instructions for a procedure. Spiegelhalter doesn’t go over any algorithms; he shows the results produced by the particular algorithm for generating classification trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1:\n\n\n\nGenome-wide association studies involve measuring many (say, 500,000) features of a person’s DNA. By comparing this huge number of features across dozens of people, some with and others without a disease, researchers try to figure out which genes might be involved in the disease. Put this in the context of \\(p\\) and \\(n\\) in the paragraphs on p. 145-145. (locator phrase: “Data can also be ‘big’”)\n  question id: S06-QB1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2:\n\n\n\nWhat is a confusion matrix?\n  question id: S06-QB2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3:\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to prediction of a binary outcome variable, what are sensitivity and specificity?\n  question id: S06-QB3 \n\n\n\nS6-before.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit collected answers here"
