Then go through the familiar “Collect answers” and submission process. Your “answers” will be the contents of the Active R Chunks that you have run.\nThese principles apply to all class sessions, but won’t be restated explicitly in other day’s itemizations.\n\nDiscussions and Activities\n\nRossling reading\nReview of Computing Tutorial 1\nIn-class group work on computing activities (TBA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.
