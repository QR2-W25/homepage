There are some \"reading tasks\" with questions that you should answer and submit in the usual way. Equally important, however, are the many R Chunks. You're expected to play around a bit as you work through the tutorial, trying out different commands, changing names, etc. Make mistakes! That's a great way to learn. Each time you run an R chunk, that activity is stored in your browser until you close or refresh the page. Submit your work using the button and link at the bottom of the tutorial document. This will let me see what you've done, and will be a component of class participation. \n    - If you stop part way through a document with questions, chunks, etc., submit your work up to that point. When you return to the document, you can do additional work and submit that. You don't have to worry about submitting multiple times.\n    - Note that when you close a document tab, your previous entries are forgotten. But any submissions that you made previously are still safely stored at the submission collection site.\n\n- [In-class notes](../Kaplan_posts/2025-01-14-notes/2025-01-14-notes.html)\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## 4.
