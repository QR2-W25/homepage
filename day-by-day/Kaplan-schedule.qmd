January: [7](#sec-7Jan), [10](#sec-10Jan), [14](#wrn-14Jan), [17](#wrn-17Jan), [21](#wrn-21Jan), [24](#wrn-24Jan), [31](#wrn-31Jan)

##### Class Day 1. Tuesday 7 January, 2025 {#sec-7Jan .nonumber}

Orientation to QR2

- [In-class notes](../Kaplan_posts/2025-01-07-notes/2025-01-07-notes.html)

- Readings:
    - Spiegelhalter Introduction [Link to a randomly selected seller](https://www.hpb.com/the-art-of-statistics-how-to-learn-from-data/M-3646261-T.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=HPB_PMAX_ECOM&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAvvO7BhC-ARIsAGFyToXt03joDgue1IfapmsUC7FSrPIrBt4o2wGL1XtdVzn4olcYDoFnKgQaAhLMEALw_wcB)
    - Rosling Introduction [Link to a randomly selected seller of the book](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/factfulness-ten-reasons-we-re-wrong-about-the-world-and-why-things-are-better-than-you-think-9781250123824?shipto=US&curcode=USD&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAvvO7BhC-ARIsAGFyToW5RAPaZ6PKkhyWmLKWQprHQbJWUaQ-bG7qdB8L9jYw4FExpc4ZaSkaAgw-EALw_wcB)
    - Note: As a rule, you should have completed a first pass of the day's readings *before* the class meets. This being the first day, I can only ask to to try to do so.

- Discussion[:](Dailies-Kaplan/2025-01-07-notes.html)
    - Learning about data and statistics
    - Spiegelhalter Introduction [reading questions](../questions/S0-before.html)
    - Rosling Introduction [reading questions](../questions/R0-before.html)
    - Note: The items under the "Discussion" header in this document are just FYI. The readings and the reading questions are the appropriate preparation.


#### Class Day 2. Friday 10 January {#sec-10Jan .nonumber}

Block 1: Data, visualization, trends

- New readings:
    a. Spiegelhalter Chap 1 [questions](../questions/S1-before.html)
    b. Rosling Chap 1 [questions](../questions/R1-before.html)

- Assignments due before class time:
    i. Before-class reading questions as linked above.
    ii. Spiegelhalter introduction [follow-up reading questions](../questions/S0-after.html)

- Discussions[:](Dailies-Kaplan/2025-01-10-notes.html)
    - Sorting out any start-up problems
    - Spiegelhalter and Rosling readings
    - In-class orientation to computing

- [In-class notes](../Kaplan_posts/2025-01-10-notes/2025-01-10-notes.html)


#### Class Day 3. Tuesday 14 January, 2025 {#sec-14Jan}

Block 1 (cont.)

- New readings:

    a. Rosling Chap 2 & [reading questions](../questions/R2-before.html)
    b. `r tutorial_link(1)` 
    
- Discussions and Activities
    i. Rossling reading
    ii. Review of Computing Tutorial 1
    iii. In-class group work on computing activities (TBA)

- Assignments due before class time: 
    - Remember that the "New readings" section has links to the relevant reading questions. 
    - As regards the computing tutorials ... There are some "reading tasks" with questions that you should answer and submit in the usual way. Equally important, however, are the many R Chunks. You're expected to play around a bit as you work through the tutorial, trying out different commands, changing names, etc. Make mistakes! That's a great way to learn. Each time you run an R chunk, that activity is stored in your browser until you close or refresh the page. Submit your work using the button and link at the bottom of the tutorial document. This will let me see what you've done, and will be a component of class participation. 
    - If you stop part way through a document with questions, chunks, etc., submit your work up to that point. When you return to the document, you can do additional work and submit that. You don't have to worry about submitting multiple times.
    - Note that when you close a document tab, your previous entries are forgotten. But any submissions that you made previously are still safely stored at the submission collection site.

- [In-class notes](../Kaplan_posts/2025-01-14-notes/2025-01-14-notes.html)


## 4. Class Day 4 Friday 17 January {#sec-17Jan}

Block 2: Prediction

- New readings    
    a. Rosling Chap 4 & [reading questions](../questions/R4-before.html). We're skipping Rosling 3, saving that for another day.
    b. Spiegelhalter Chap 3 & [reading questions](../questions/S3-before.html)

- Start work
    i. [computing activities for Tutorial 1](https://dtkaplan.github.io/QR2-computing/exercises-1.html). Will be due before the next class meeting. You don't have to do the ones labelled "In-class". But do as many of the others as you can. 


- Assignments due:
    - As always, reading questions from new readings are due before class. 
    - The "computing activities" are due before the class day *after* the class day where they are listed under "Start work." The activities for Tutorial 1 are listed for today, so they will be due by class time on Tuesday.
    - I'll stop mentioning this explicitly for future class days.
