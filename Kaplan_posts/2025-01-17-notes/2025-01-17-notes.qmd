## Administration
    
1. I'm going to start looking at reading questions, exercises, and such on a regular schedule.

    - If you are still shakey about submitting your work, let's fix it! 
    - I want to see submissions from all of you on every document from now on.
    
2. Grading. The STEM faculty have set a rule for instructors about grading.

> Half or more of graded content should be presented and done in a classroom setting. 

- I'm thinking to make this about 50%. Split more or less evenly between class participation and short (15 min) inclass quizzes roughly once a week. 
- I won't necessarily tell you in advance about such a quiz. If you need to make one up, we can do it in my office.

## What is a prediction?

- We extend the everyday meaning: Saying something about the as-yet-unknown value of a variable based on known values for other variables.
    - Not just "Will you get sick?" but "Are you sick now?"
    
- The proper form for a prediction.

- Risk and "risk factors"
